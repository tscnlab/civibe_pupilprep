I also checked if minimum(sequence duration in seconds) is equal to sequence duration in seconds corresponding to minimum duration in samples (value in brackets vs value without). They are not equal, further confirming that sampling is not uniform. This can cause issues in filtering the signal and will need to be kept in mind for preprocessing."
