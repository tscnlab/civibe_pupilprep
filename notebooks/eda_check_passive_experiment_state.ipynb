    "Passive time doesn't seem to have outliers in terms of length in samples but there are a few trials where 10 samples of it equal to 20 seconds. It appears to only amount to 1 outlier sequence per participant. Apart from that, the passive times don't exceed 1 s. Segmenting the signal would be easier if the passive times were excluded because they appear to be inhomogeneous. However, this way the 1 second baseline wouldn't be taken from right before the stimulation start. I would suggest including these passive times into the 1 second baseline in non-outlier trials and looking closer at the outliers separately. Then it could be determined how the 20 seconds transition is distributed among the 10 samples."
